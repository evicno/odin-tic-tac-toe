# odin-tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe JavaScript project from The Odin Project.

This project emphasizes on using as little global code as possible with IIFE modules and Factory Functions.

## Features
- **2 players mode** with the possibility to customize players names
- **Score management:** Tracking points over multiple rounds

##  Concepts applied
- **Modules (IIFE):** to encapsulate game logic and display control (avoid global variables)
- **Factory Functions**
- Clear distinction between logic and DOM manipulation
- **State Management:** clean reset of the board without reloading the page

## Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Challenges
The biggest challenge was moving from a linear code thinking to a modular architecture. 

I learned the importance of anticipating DOM requirements when writing JavaScript logic. 

I also had to remove some parts of the initial code (like the gameboard module that became useless) to make it clearer and more efficient.
